# Stack

Stack of elements of type T is a finite sequence of elements of T together with the following operations:

- Create Stack, Leaving it Empty
- Determine whether the stack is empty or not
- Determine whether the stack is full or not
- Find the size of Stack
- Push a new entry(Generic) onto the top of stack, provided the stack is not full.
- Pop the entry off the top of the stack, provided the stack is not empty.
- Retrieve the Top entry off the stack, provided the stack is not empty.
- Travserse the Stack, visiting each entry.
- Clear the Stack to make it empty


Stack could be implemented using two main approaches

- Arrays 
- Linked Listss

each approach has a tradeoff

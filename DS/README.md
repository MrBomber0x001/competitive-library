## Tips to learn DS

those tips are not solid, but they've helped me alot, and I hope it will help you too

1. Learn Data structure concept
    - Draw it  
    - Create API/operation methods (Accessing Mechanisms)
2. Build the Data structure
    - Pseudocode the implementation
    - Code the data structure constructor
3. Utilize the Data structure
    - Put your data structure to work!
    - Pair it with an algorithm if needed
4. Understand Data structure
    - What is the time complexity?
    - How can you optimize it?
5. practice on leetcode.
